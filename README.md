# HandleBridge

An open-source tool for the Trust Wallet community that turns your `handle@trust` into a universal, shareable webpage for all your crypto addresses.

## Why HandleBridge?

Your Trust Wallet handle is a great way to receive crypto, but it doesn't work with most exchanges or other wallets. This forces you back to copying and pasting long, complex addresses.

**HandleBridge solves this.** It gives your `@trust` handle a simple, public webpage, making it truly universal. Now you can share one clean link with anyone, on any platform.

## Core Features

*   **Quick Lookup**: Instantly find and display all addresses linked to any `@trust` handle.
*   **Shareable Profile**: Get a permanent, personal link to share with anyone. **See a live example: [https://handlebridge.vercel.app/offici5l](https://handlebridge.vercel.app/offici5l)**
